# Glossy MSP430 - A Remote GDB Debugger for MSP430

## Primary Goal

This project aims to create a tool similar to the 
[Black Magic Probe](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic) found on 
the ARM processor, but for the Texas Instruments MSP430 MCU line.

The project is roughly based on the Daniel Beer's **mspdebug** but with 
many mix-ins from the **slau320aj - MSP430â„¢ Programming With the JTAG Interface** 
and the **MSP Debug Stack 3.15.1.1**.

Coding is performed in C++ with a self tailored *template library* acting 
as a *Hardware Abstraction Layer*, refactoring C code if necessary.

The development is made using the outstanding **VisualGDB** and 
**Visual Studio Community 2022**, which IMHO is currently the best 
development combination available for embedded development. Unfortunately 
*VisualGDB* is not a free product but it is worth every buck I paid for. 
So a *makefile* alternative is planned for those that only wants to build 
the binaries.

## What is the Glossy MSP430

The **Glossy MSP430** is a modern, in-application debugging tool for 
embedded microprocessors. It implements the 
[GDB Remote Serial Protocol](https://www.embecosm.com/appnotes/ean4/embecosm-howto-rsp-server-ean4-issue-2.html), 
which allows you see what is going on *inside* an application running on 
an embedded **MSP430 microprocessor** while it executes. It is able to 
control and examine the state of the target microprocessor using a 
**JTAG** 
or **Spy-Bi-Wire** (SBW) port and on-chip debug logic provided by the 
microprocessor. The probe connects to a host computer using a standard 
USB interface. The user is able to control exactly what happens using the 
GNU source level debugging software, GDB.

### The Special Motivation

The first impression of such a project, is the "Yet another On Chip 
Debugger". But this is a very simplistic view. If you evaluate standard 
MSP430 interfaces, the typical *MSP430.dll+probe combo*, you will notice 
that the amount of operations that a probe is capable to do in each 
request is too simplistic and fine grained. The main logic is coded 
inside the MSP430.dll.

This ends up in lots of small USB packets, which indeed uses a 
half-duplex principle for the communication. The Windows driver 
stack-based structure, may be extremely flexible, but at the cost of 
performance, it ends that you cannot saturate an USB bus without using 
huge data payloads. Fact is that a 12Mb USB link will constantly idle in 
the current *MSP430.dll* architecture. This adds latencies between every 
short messages.

GDB on the other side uses a higher level protocol and the JTAG probe 
requires more embedded intelligence to fully attend a request, reducing 
the number of in and outs to complete a request.  
As a result, faster responses are expected and that is exactly what you 
experience with the **Black Magic Probe** solution for the ARM platform. 

Another important point: This is a my hobby project and no boss or time 
schedules are priorities here. I am reading and reviewing all STM32 
hardware documentation, to extract all possible performance for this 
application. For example, bit banging is the fastest way to develop a 
JTAG/SBW protocol and currently I've finished development of a JTAG 
implementation based on a combination of SPI+DMA+Timer to generate the 
**TMS signal logic** and the result of this work added the following 
benefits:
- Transmit a request at **9 MHz** using a STM32F103 controller 
(**72MHz / 8 = 9MHz**). This is at least double the speed of the best 
case scenario for bit-banging (by the way, MSP430 JTAG interface limits 
this interface to **10MHz**).
- Easy possibility to select lower speed to **4.5**, **2.25**, **1.13** 
and **0.56 MHz** and improve connection when using lengthy cables or low 
supply voltages.
- On newer STM32 variants it is possible to reach the **10 MHz** limit by 
choosing MCU clocks of **80** or **160 MHz**.
- Possibility to use DMA to feed data to the SPI device while MCU is 
decoding the next request, which shortens the latency between requests.

The wiki contains details on this work.


## Differences of the Glossy MSP430 and the Black Magic Probe

The following specifications where added or changed to accomplish the 
MSP430 version:
- JTAG pin-outs using TI 14-pin standard.
- Instead of SWD, the MSP430 uses the Spy-Bi-Wire as a two wire protocol. 
- The **TRACESWO** is not present on a MSP430 MCU.
- Variable JTAG transfer speed.
- Control of supply voltage, like on the MSP430-FET.

Summarizing, these are the features:
- Identifies almost 500 parts from the MSP430 families: MSP430F1xx, 
MSP430F2xx, MSP430Gxxx, MSP430F4xx, MSP430F5xx, MSP430FRxxx. [completed]
- Connects to the target processor using the JTAG interfaces. [completed]
- Connects to the target processor using the Spy-Bi-Wire (SBW) 
interfaces. [TBD]
- Provides full debugging functionality, including: flash memory 
breakpoints, memory and register examination, flash memory programming, 
etc. [partially functional]
- Interface to the host computer is a standard USB CDC ACM device 
(virtual serial port), which does not require special drivers on Windows, 
Linux or OS X. [TBD]
- Implements the GDB extended remote debugging protocol for seamless 
integration with the GNU debugger and other GNU development tools. 
[almost complete]
- Implement an asynchronous design of the JTAG protocol, for 
implementations using DMA (like SPI, JTAG receives while it sends data; 
but not all commands requires a response; very bad for synchronous 
accesses) [TBD]
- Implements USB DFU class for easy firmware upgrade as updates become 
available. [TBD]
- Works with Windows, Linux and Mac environments. [TBD]

With the gdb partnership, the *Glossy MSP430* allows you to:

- Load your application into the target Flash memory, FRAM or RAM.
- Single step through your program.
- Run your program in real-time and halt on demand.
- Examine and modify CPU registers and memory.
- Obtain a call stack backtrace.
- Set up to 8 hardware assisted breakpoints.


## Software Platform

This repository has a VS2022 solution which contains various projects. 
In general this project can be divided in some distinct efforts:
- A Hardware Abstraction Layer
- The firmware source code
- A chip device database (a catalog having ~500 MSP430 variants). The 
original XML database can be found in [ChipInfo/ExtractChipInfo/MSP430-devices/devices](ChipInfo/ExtractChipInfo/MSP430-devices/devices)
- Unit Tests

A considerable effort was done to compact all required chip database 
information into a microcontroller with 128KB of Flash memory.

Two robust hardware alternative were planned with a rugged and 
professional look. For both options support for flexible 
target supply voltages was considered.

Prototypes board were fabricated, but current circuitry evolved since 
and schematics and PCB design are kept for physical model, where 
mechanical dimensions are the main target.

For development, larger boards were developed, based on development 
boards, like BluePill, BlackPill and a pair of STM32 Nucleo boards. These 
larger boards have testpoints and connections to help monitoring of 
supply voltages, signals and a logic analyzer.

Current options are:

- A prototype option using the Blue-pill or Black-Pill. This is currently 
the best option for those that want to experiment the project. Please 
note that this option limits the supply voltage to 3.3V, which is good 
for usual prototype boards, but many other MSP430 based devices will 
operate in lower levels to really have a benefit of the *Ultra Low 
Power* design of this line.  
![BlackPill-BMP-fs8.png](Hardware/BlackPill-BMP/images/BlackPill-BMP-fs8.png)  
[Details for this option can be found here](Hardware/BlackPill-BMP/README.md).

- Conceptually similar to the previous prototype, a board was developed 
to be used with a couple of Nucleo-32 boards. This is a new move caused 
by the chip mangle, since the old STM32F103 is now a rarity and I don't 
want additional delays when fiddling with clones. Hardware for newer 
parts are also more robust and faster. Although this prototype board is 
ready and running here, I am still concentrated in my initial proposal 
and later I will move definitively to newer hardware as I already have 
bought these MCU parts.
![L432KC-fs8.png](Hardware/L432KC/images/L432KC-fs8.png)  
[Details for this option can be found here](Hardware/L432KC/README.md).

- BMPMSP: a preliminary physical prototype that suits into a nice form 
factor. The schematics has evolved since it was released back in Mid 
2021 and a new board will be produced for the final product.  
![MSPBMP.png](Hardware/MSPBMP/images/MSPBMP.png)
[Details here](Hardware/MSPBMP/README.md).

> At the time of this writing a redesign is being fabricated by JLCPCB. 
> This new design has an updated circuit diagram. A physical model will 
> become reality in the next couple of months, after implementation of 
> the VCP support.

- BMPMSP2-stick: Same as above but more compact. It fits into the *Baite* 
plastic case, quite common on the ATMega world.  
![MSPBMP2-stick.png](Hardware/MSPBMP2-stick/images/MSPBMP2-stick.png)  
[Details here](Hardware/MSPBMP2-stick/README.md).


Note that for both options you will find a KiCad project on the repo.

Last but not least, it is planed to support ST-Link V2 clones using the 
clone hardware provided with them, but at the cost of some important 
features:
- no support to power supply voltages other than 3.3V
- no standard MSP JTAG connector
- VCP (UART) function requires a hardware mod.
- Clones having 10-pin connectors will be limited to the SBW bus.

So, a low cost option will be possible to make tests before going to a 
more featured and costly option.



## Target Prototype Boards

Besides the series of affordable targets of the *LaunchPad series* from 
TI, some other targets requires prototype boards for the development of 
the firmware, specially in the initial stages where development aims 
the JTAG protocol.

On the repo you will find KiCad prototypes for:

- Generic legacy MSP430 board, for many variants, such as **MSP4301611**, 
**MSP430F249** and many others. This board has pads for dual pin-outs and 
instead of a single option with the MCU at the top, an alternative 
pin-out is also found at the bottom. These optional pins are compatible 
with the **MSP430G2955** and other variants.  
These devices follows specification of the **SLAU049** and the 
**SLAU144** users guide:  
![MSP_Proto.png](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU049_SLAU144/images/MSP_Proto.png)  
[Details here](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU049_SLAU144/README.md).

- For the **SLAU208** users guide based family a second option was designed 
for the **MSP430F5418** and its siblings.  
![F5418.png](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU208_F5418/images/F5418.png)  
[Details here](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/F5418/README.md).

- After the MSF430F5xxx generation TI lanched the first **FRAM** 
generation and a new users guide, the **SLAU272** and a bit later a 
rough optimization introducing the **SLAU367** users guide. Both families 
have very similar pinouts for the **TSSOP-38** package, so it is possible 
to share a single design to test both families:  
![FR2476.png](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU272_SLAU367/images/SLAU272_FR5739-fs8.png)  
[Details here](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU272_SLAU367/README.md).

- In between the **FRAM** line of chips, a special line was release 
similar to **MSP430F2xxx** family, but with very precise A/D converters.  
These are based on the **TSSOP-28** package and the following board 
was developed:
![SLAU335.png](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU335/images/SLAU335-fs8.png)  
[Details here](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU335/README.md).

- For the most recent generation of **FRAM** based devices, which are 
based on the **SLAU445** users guide, a prototype board for the 
**MSP430FR2476** was designed:  
![FR2476.png](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU445_FR2476/images/FR2476.png)  
[Details here](Hardware/Target_Proto_Boards/SLAU445_FR2476/README.md).


## Secondary Goal

New coding is performed in C++ with a self tailored *template library* 
and it serves to demonstrate that modern C++ can easily outperform C 
development with the use of the ``constexpr`` keyword.

The ``constexpr`` keyword sits like a *glove* to embedded development as 
most peripheral register addresses are pure constants.

So very complex logic decisions are simplified wherever possible during 
compile time for every ``constexpr`` in the template library and 
unnecessary code are automatically removed and the final result is just 
a couple of lines.
