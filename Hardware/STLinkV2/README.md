The first build option, is a design based on the ST-Link V2 form factor. 
So, one can buy some cheap ST-Link V2 clone, discard the main-board of 
the clone and install a new hardware on it, to reuse the housing, which 
is very pretty and has an additional connector that can be used as a 
serial port. Besides, recent clones are coming without branding, which is 
perfect in our case:

This is the 3D model:

I've just bough on Amazon or AliExpress both ST-Link devices and replaced the contents by the PCB's. The PCB's were produced by JLCPCB, which already mounted the SMD components, helping much on the final result.

The picture below shows the physical prototype replacing the cloned 
ST-Link:

By closing the case it looks like this:

See that the 14-pin connector may look strange here, since the case is 
originally intended for a 20-pin connector.
