On the first option, the design is based on the ST-Link V2 form factor, so you can buy some cheap ST-Link V2 clone, discard the main-board of the clone and install a new hardware on it to reuse the housing, which is very pretty and has an additional connector that can be used as a serial port.

I've just bough on Amazon or AliExpress both ST-Link devices and replaced the contents by the PCB's. The PCB's were produced by JLCPCB, which already mounted the SMD components, helping much on the final result.
